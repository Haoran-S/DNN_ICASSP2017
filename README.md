# DNN_WMMSE

MATLAB code to reproduce our works on DNN research.

Simply run "main.m", you will get the result for Gaussian IC case.

To get results for other sections, slightly modification may apply.

We also provide some pre-trained functions to show our results in Table. 1 & Table 2.

To run our code, Neuron Network Toolbox and Deep Learning Toolbox need to be installed first.

Code has been tested successfully on MATLAB 2016b prerelease platform.
